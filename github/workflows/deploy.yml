# This is a GitHub Actions workflow for automatically deploying a website to GitHub Pages.
name: Deploy to GitHub Pages

# The workflow will be triggered every time you push to any branch
# or when a pull request is opened or updated targeting the main branch.
on:
  push:
    # This will trigger the workflow for all branches to run the build and checks.
    branches:
      - '*'
  # We also trigger on pull requests to run the build and checks.
  pull_request:
    # This will trigger the workflow for all pull requests targeting the main branch.
    branches:
      - '*'

# The workflow consists of a single job: build_and_deploy.
jobs:
  build_and_deploy:
    # The job will only run if the event is a push to the main branch
    # or if the workflow is triggered by a Pull Request.
    # This ensures deployment only happens from the main branch.
    # The job will run on an Ubuntu virtual machine.
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # The steps to be executed.
    steps:
      # 1. Checkout the repository code.
      # This step is mandatory to access the project files.
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # 2. Setup Node.js.
      # This is necessary if your project requires dependency installation or building.
      # We assume you have a package.json file with a "build" script.
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20'

      # 3. Install dependencies using Yarn.
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: yarn install

      # 4. Run the build script using Yarn.
      # This step executes the build command, which usually creates a 'dist' or 'build' folder.
      # If your script has a different name, change it here.
      - name: Build project
        run: yarn build

      # The following steps for deployment will only run if the event is a push to the main branch.
      # This prevents deployment from other branches or pull requests.
