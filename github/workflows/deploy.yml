    steps:
      # 1. Checkout the repository code.
      # This step is mandatory to access the project files.
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # 2. Setup Node.js.
      # This is necessary if your project requires dependency installation or building.
      # We assume you have a package.json file with a "build" script.
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4

      # 3. Install dependencies using Yarn.
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: yarn install

      # 4. Run the build script using Yarn.
      # This step executes the build command, which usually creates a 'dist' or 'build' folder.
      # If your script has a different name, change it here.
      - name: Build project
        run: yarn build

      # 5. Configure GitHub Pages.
      # This step configures the environment for publishing to GitHub Pages.
      - name: Configure GitHub Pages
        uses: actions/configure-pages@v4

      # 6. Upload the artifact for publishing.
      # We upload the content of the 'dist' folder, as this is the standard name for
      # a built project. If you have a different folder name, change it.

        uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v4
